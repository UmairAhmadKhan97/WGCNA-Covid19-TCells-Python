# WGCNA-Covid19-TCells-Python
Python version of R's WGCNA using a biweight midcorrelation similarity matrix and a topological overlap measure for the network proximity measure. 
I find hub genes with network modules using the Louvain method. 
This method creates a biological graph or network to pinpoint master regulators in the
viral-host response in SarsCov2 infection.
